    "spaceship.section1": "The Padawans project was an university project for TGC (computer graphics technics) of my degree. It was asked to develop a game using a given framework built by the chair. Adquired knowledge during the subject were applied, good practices, 3d object manipulation, rendering optimization, and shaders developing for the adition of graphic effects.",

    "spaceship.section3.title" : "Game summary",
    "spaceship.section3": "The game is about piloting the famous X-wing Starfighter through the Death Star (based on a scene from Star Wars Episode V) The player fires a special missile into the exhaust port in an attempt to explode the spaceship. To reach this point, the player must destroy turrets that shoot without mercy, dodge enemy spaceships that will also attack, and avoid colliding with the walls in the scenery.

    "spaceship.section45": "Bullet, an external library was used in this game in order to detect collisions between the different elements of the game. Spaceships, turrets, missiles, the scenery, and other obstacles participate in the physics engine of Bullet.",
    "spaceship.section5.title" : "The camera",
    "spaceship.section5": "It has a camera that follows constantly to the spaceship from behind, but with a subtle delay respect of the movements, which gives a better feeling of realism in the navigation of the scenery.",

    "spaceship.section7.title" : "The strategy",
    "spaceship.section7" : "The goal of the game is make it to the other side of the Death Star, and shoot the special missil in the exhaust port. There are basically two ways to do it. Fly low through the tunnel avoiding turrets, (also this way spaceships won't find you) or fly high away from them, but facing various spaceships that chase you.",

    "spaceship.section9" : "The enemy spaceships will chase you if you are under their visibility radar within a maximum distance, and over the tunnel with turrets. When out of their scope, they will coast in a straight line roaming through space until you cross their path. Turrets are motionless although more abundant in quantity. They will only shoot when you fly by within a maximum distance, however their visibility angle is not limited. Finally, the most static but relentless enemies are the walls and various obstacles that block your path. You must dodge them because these also will drain your energy.",
